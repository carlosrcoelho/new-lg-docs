# Conversation Chain

This is the simplest example of a `Conversation Chain`. It takes a message as input and returns a response. The response is generates by a language model (LLM).

In the LangFlow example, we used ChatOpenAI as the LLM, but you can use any LLM that has an API. Make sure to get the API key from the LLM provider. For example, [ChatOpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) requires you to create an account to get your API key.
