# Creating Flows

Creating flows with LangFlow is easy. Simply drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them together to create your pipeline. LangFlow provides a range of [LangChain components](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html) to choose from, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.

Once done, you can export your flow as a JSON file by clicking the "Export" button in the top right corner of the canvas. Then, load the flow in Python with:

```py
from langflow import load_flow_from_json

flow = load_flow_from_json("path/to/flow.json")
# Now you can use it like any chain
flow("Hey, have you heard of LangFlow?")
```
