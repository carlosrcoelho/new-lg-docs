# MidJourney Prompt Chain

With `MidJourney Prompt Chain`, you can use it to generate new MidJourney prompts. You can just type anything you like to build an image script.

### ⛓️LangFlow example

For example, you can type something like this:

```bash
Dragon
```

Then, you have a response, something like this, in our case:

```text
Imagine a mysterious forest, the trees are tall and ancient, their branches reaching up to the sky. Through the darkness, a dragon emerges from the shadows, its scales shimmering in the moonlight. Its wingspan is immense, and its eyes glow with a fierce intensity. It is a majestic and powerful creature, one that commands both respect and fear.
```

For this example, we used [`OpenAI`](https://platform.openai.com/) as the LLM.
