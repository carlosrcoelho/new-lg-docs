# Python Function

The `Python Function` component can use as a versatile tool for text manipulation. By allowing customization and incorporating search capabilities, the function enables the language model to perform various operations on input strings according to specific requirements. It provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to different use cases, empowering the language model.

In this example, True or False is indicated based on Brazil's zip codes. This function allows the format "XXXXX-XXX".

```python
import re

def is_brazilian_zipcode(zipcode: str) -> bool:
    pattern = r"\d{5}-?\d{3}"

    # Check if the zip code matches the pattern
    if re.match(pattern, zipcode):
        return True

    return False
```

**Components used in this flow:**

A `Tool` is a way for an agent to interact with the function.

*Name*:
```text
Is Brazilian Zip Code?
```

*Description*:
```text
Checks if the given zip code is from Brazil.
```
 *Return Direct*:
 When a tool is called, it is often desirable to have its output returned directly to the user. You can do this by setting the return_direct flag for a tool to be True.

`Conversation Buffer Memory` stores messages and extracts them into variables.

The `initialize_agent` construct a json agent from an LLM and tools.

For this example, we used [`OpenAI`](https://platform.openai.com/) as the LLM.
