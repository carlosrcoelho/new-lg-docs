# MidJourney Prompt Chain

With `MidJourney Prompt Chain`, you can use it to generate new MidJourney prompts. You can just type anything you like to build an image script.

## ⛓️LangFlow example

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import ZoomableImage from '/home/carlos/repo/new-lg-docs/src/ZoomableImage.js';


<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: 'img/midjourney-prompt-chain.png',
    dark: 'img/midjourney-prompt-chain-dark.png',
  }}
/>

For example, you can type something like this:

```bash
Dragon
```

Then, you have a response, something like this, in our case:

```text
Imagine a mysterious forest, the trees are tall and ancient, their branches reaching up to the sky. Through the darkness, a dragon emerges from the shadows, its scales shimmering in the moonlight. Its wingspan is immense, and its eyes glow with a fierce intensity. It is a majestic and powerful creature, one that commands both respect and fear.
```
