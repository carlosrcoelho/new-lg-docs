# Multiple Vectorstores

A vector store agent collect data from a source, map the text to a vector space, store it in a vector database and search the vector database in natural language.

<!-- A vector store is a specialized database designed for the efficient storage of documents and their embeddings. It enables the retrieval of the most relevant documents for a given query by comparing the similarity of their embeddings to the query's embedding. -->

We can utilize the vector store to initialize an agent with multiple vector stores and leverage the agent for routing between them effortlessly.

Learn more about Multiple Vectorstores [here](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/toolkits/examples/vectorstore.html?highlight=Multiple%20Vector%20Stores#multiple-vectorstores).

The example shown below is a flow of multiple vectorstores. The data source here is a Wikipedia about Harry Potter and the State of the Union TXT file.

When you build your flow, go to chat and type a query. Based on the data sources provided, the agent will search for the information you requested.

## ⛓️LangFlow example

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import ZoomableImage from '/src/ZoomableImage.js';


<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: 'img/multiple-vectorstores.png',
    dark: 'img/multiple-vectorstores-dark.png',
  }}
/>

 **Components used in this flow:**

`TextLoader` loads text from a file. Get the file used [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-your-data/blob/master/state_of_the_union.txt).

By using `WebBaseLoader`, you can load all text from webpages into a document format that we can use downstream. Web path used:

```txt
https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter
```

`CharacterTextSplitter` implements splitting text based on characters.

Text splitters operate as follows:

- Split the text into small, meaningful chunks (usually sentences).

- Combine these small chunks into larger ones until they reach a certain size (measured by a function).

- Once a chunk reaches the desired size, make it its piece of text and create a new chunk with some overlap to maintain context.

*Separator*:

```txt
.
```

*Chunk size*:

```txt
4000
```

*Chunk overlap*:

```txt
200
```

Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or any entities in a vector space. In the example we used wrapper around [OpenAI Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings) models. Make sure to get the API key from the LLM provider, in this case [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

`Chroma` vector databases can be used as vector stores to conduct a semantic search or to select examples, thanks to a wrapper around them.

A `VectorStoreInfo` set information about the vector store, such as the name and description.

**First VectorStoreInfo**

*Name*:

```txt
State of the union.
```

*Description*:

```txt
State of the union text.
```

**Second VectorStoreInfo**

*Name*:

```txt
Harry Potter Wikipedia.
```

*Description*:

```txt
Wikipedia about Harry Potter.
```
For this example, we used [`ChatOpenAI`](https://platform.openai.com/) as the LLM.

`VectorStoreRouterAgent` construct an agent that routes between multiple vectorstores.
