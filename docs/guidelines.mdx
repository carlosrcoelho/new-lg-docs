# Guidelines

## Component

Components are the building blocks of the flows. They are made of inputs, outputs, and parameters that define their functionality, providing a convenient and straightforward way to compose LLM-based applications. Learn more about components and how they work in the LangChain [documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/category/components) section.


### Component's Features

<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  During the flow creation process, you will notice colored circles attached to one or both sides of a component. These
  circles represent the availability to connect to other components, while the colors are type hints (hover over a circle to see details connection details).</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  For example, if you select a <code>ConversationChain</code> component, you will see orange  <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>o</span>  and purple  <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>o</span>  input circles. These circles are called Handles, and they indicate that this component accepts an LLM and a Memory component as inputs. The red asterisk <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>*</span> means that at least one input of that type is required.
</div>

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import ZoomableImage from '/src/theme/ZoomableImage.js';

<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <ZoomableImage
    alt="Docusaurus themed image"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/single-compenent.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto' }}
  />
</div>


<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
On the top right corner, you will find the Node Status icon üî¥. Make the necessary connections to make a flow work, and once the background validation is completed, the Node Status lights green üü¢. Hover over it to reveal the outputs going through a component in case of success or the detected error in case of failure.
</div>


<div>
  Use the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è to edit the component's parameters and delete it by clicking the trash can icon üóëÔ∏è.

## Features

  On the top right corner of the screen, you will find options such as <strong>Code</strong>, <strong>Import</strong>, <strong>Export</strong>, <strong>Dark Mode</strong>, and <strong>Notifications</strong>, as displayed in the image below:
</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px', display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <ZoomableImage
    alt="Docusaurus themed image"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('img/features.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto' }}
  />
</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}>
Further down, we will explain each of these options.

### Code

The Code button shows you code snippets to use the created flow as an API.

**Python API Tab:**

The code snippet is a Python script that makes a POST request to a local API endpoint to get a prediction based on a message input.

```bash
import requests
import json

API_URL = "http://localhost:3000/predict"

def predict(message):
    with open("New Flow.json", "r") as f:
        json_data = json.load(f)
    payload = {'exported_flow': json_data, 'message': message}
    response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload)
    return response.json() # JSON {"result": "Response"}

print(predict("Your message"))
```

**Python Code Tab:**

Through the LangFlow package, you can load a flow from a JSON file and use it as a typical LangChain object.

```bash
from langflow import load_flow_from_json

flow = load_flow_from_json("New Flow.json")
# Now you can use it like any chain
flow("Hey, have you heard of LangFlow?")
```

### Import and Export

Flows can be exported and imported as JSON files. There are pre-build examples in the **Import** section. Check them out.

If you want to contribute with your own examples, send a pull request to the [GitHub langflow_examples](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow_examples) repo. Please ensure your example follows the [LangFlow code of conduct](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If your example uses any third-party libraries or packages, please include them in your PR.

## Chat

Once a flow is appropriately validated, click the bottom right corner chat icon to start a conversation, where a screen will pop up. Use the eraser icon to clear the chat history and refresh the conversation.
